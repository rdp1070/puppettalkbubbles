Alright so I got a drink and a sandwich. Maybe I should get a little treat too, I deserve it! /n Let me get some of that toffee! Lately my friends have been calling me by a new nickname that reminds me of it. Stoff short for Kristoff! My mom still calls me Kris though. /n
Okay so I got my drink, sandwich, and some toff for dessert. Thatâ€™s it for my order I think! /n Can you put my new nickname on my order?
