Speaking of marriage, my wife Dr. Mrs. Professor Mister is also a programmer. She works at Boogle. She was a student just like you guys studying data structures. /n Speaking of data structures, we have an upcoming quiz next week. Make sure to review arrays and maps and other collections. /n
Haha sounds like programming is a lot like archeology too! You even see warnings alerting you of danger! (If you don’t fix your code…) /n So once more, what’s the quiz subject next week?
