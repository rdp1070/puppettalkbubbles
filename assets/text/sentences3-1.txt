I’m so glad you could make it. You won’t believe the horrible day I’ve had. /n So I was looking forward to dinner. I really love this place, especially the spaghetti. /n
Lately, I’ve been feeling like I should try more pasta. But I don’t like experimenting with food that much. /n Why’d you pick this restaurant?
