So today at work, Geraldine was being herself again. Caused just so much trouble. /n She broke the printer so I couldn’t print out any of my files today. We had to contact IT. It’s still not fixed. /n
We have a meeting coming up on Monday. I’m trying to figure out what to do. /n How can I get these files out on time?
