I’m kind of hungry too. I’ve just been eating cup ramen the last few days to get by the busy season, I need a break. /n I could definitely go for a sandwich. It looks like you have new lunch specials. I’ve been into turkey lately. I’m so tired of eating ham. /n
Let’s get some cheddar on that too. Wait no, swiss. Actually, cheddar and rye bread. No. Wheat. Got it? /n Can I order my sandwich?
