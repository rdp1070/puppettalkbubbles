So lately, I’ve been watching a lot of travel vlogs. People have been going to so many different places. /n Italian food is great but lately, I’m thinking I’d like to visit France. Maybe see the Eiffel Tower. I’m not as interested in Germany but it could be fun too. /n
I think I’ll have some PTO in the spring…Maybe we should plan something together. /n Where do you want to go for vacation?
